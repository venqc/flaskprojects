    Beautiful is better than ugly.
    Explicit is better than implicit.
    Simple is better than complex.
    Complex is better than complicated.
    Flat is better than nested.
    Sparse is better than dense.
    Readability counts.
    Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
    Although practicality beats purity.
    Errors should never pass silently.
    Unless explicitly silenced.
    In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
    There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.[c]
    Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
    Now is better than never.
    Although never is often better than right now.[d]
    If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
    If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
    Namespaces are one honking great idea â€“ let's do more of those!
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_of_Python
"Think twice before you start programming or you will program twice before you start thinking". 

"First, solve the problem. Then, make it work, make it right, make it fast". 

"Your job as a developer is not just to create code that you can work with easily, but to create code that others can also work with easily"

"Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live". 

"Coding like poetry should be short and concise". 

"Python plays a key role in our production pipeline".

    Convention over configuration
    There's more than one way to do it

Check later - DRY, WET, AHA, SSOT/SPOT, YAGNI etc.
